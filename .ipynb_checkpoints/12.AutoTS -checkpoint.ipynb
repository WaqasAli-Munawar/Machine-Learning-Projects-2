    "### What is AutoTS in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AutoTS** means Automatic Time Series, it is a machine learning library in Python used for time series forecasting. Some of the popular features of the AutoTS library in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be used to find the best time series forecasting model which depends on the type of data we are using.\n",
    "* It can handle both the univariate and multivariate time series.\n",
    "* It can also handle messy data by removing and filling the **NaN values** and it can also handle the outliers.\n",
    "* We can use the models provided by this Python library for deployment also.\n",
    "\n",
    "These were some of the important features of the **AutoTS** library in Python. It has more features for time series forecasting, we can explore more about this library from its official documentation from [here](https://pypi.org/project/AutoTS/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, we will use **AutoTS library** for stock price prediction."
